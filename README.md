# CNNLens
Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the workign tool available at https://ghodsimahdi.github.io/CNNLens/. The tool is optimized for 75% zoom on Google Chrome.

The data files are two JSON text files("data.json" containing the architecture, and "prob.json" is the result of the classifcation for the input image) 

The tool also requires two directories containign the images (one directory for the Forward Activation Map and one for Guided Back Propagation. The sample ones are given under "images" directory. Please, refer to our report for the further explanation). The two directories included prefilled in our webapp points to two folders that are uploaded on the server.
